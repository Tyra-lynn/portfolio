          <h2> A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
          <p>I haven't had the opportunity to attend many schools; in fact, I have only ever been to two, which, to be honest, doesn't bother me at all. Change is not something I particularly enjoy. My educational journey began at Sacred Heart of Jesus School, where I completed both my nursery and primary schooling. Currently, I am enrolled at St. Mary's Girls' Secondary School, where I have been since the start of my secondary education.
            I consider myself a creative individual, finding great joy in reading. One of my favourite pastimes is spending hours immersed in a book, allowing the thrill of reading to captivate me. Writing holds a special place in my heart as well. While I enjoy writing in general, poetry reigns as my ultimate favourite. Whether it involves composing my own verses or delving into the works of other poets, the beauty of poetry never fails to bring a smile to my face. In addition, I have recently developed an interest in painting. Although my skill may not yet be refined, the sheer pleasure I derive from the process makes it a cherished hobby.
